Remember! These are from a game released in 1989 on a platform released in 1986. We are talking the infancy of personal desktop computing here. These are ogg files from the actual game. I only got a handful of sounds. I know there are some cooler stuff at later levels. Be sure to at least check out the last one!

**Crystal's and Enemy**

When you think about it, the Apple IIgs was <em>way</em> ahead of its time!
