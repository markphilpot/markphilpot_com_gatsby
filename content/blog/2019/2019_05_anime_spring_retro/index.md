[TOC]

I'm actually *very* behind on finishing up the spring season, but I wanted to get this out, so here we are.


### [Isekai Quartet](https://anilist.co/anime/104454)

I'm almost done with this one -- since it's a short and if you enjoy the shows that it's remixing then I think it's worth carving out a bit of time to binge it. Honestly, I was expecting more, but that may have just been my miscalibrated expectations. A second season has been confirmed, so if you like it you can expect even more.



### [Fairy Gone](https://anilist.co/anime/107418)

The OST and insert songs have been the sole reason I've kept up with this show. Definitely mediocre but with enough substance so that I at least want to finish it.




### [Boku-tachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai](https://anilist.co/anime/103900)

Another mediocre show that we *definitely haven't seen before* ðŸ™„

There is enough playfulness and banter that it was fun to follow along, but we all know who best girl is:

### [Hitoribocchi no Marumaru Seikatsu](https://anilist.co/anime/101386)

Anime of the season! So incredibly adorable and surprisingly relatable. I really hope there is a second season (but as of yet, nothing confirmed). There is a manga (which I don't think has an official English translation yet) where I'll hopefully be able to get even more Bocchi goodness.




### [Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine](https://anilist.co/anime/104989)

Surprisingly good, but nothing to write home about. Given the size of a baseball team, there is no opportunity to dive into the back story of every character, so we only get a few choice explorations, which is kind of a shame because there was probably a lot of good material there that just had to be cut for time.
