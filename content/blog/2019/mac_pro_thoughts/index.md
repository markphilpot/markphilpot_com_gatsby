tl;dr - The new Mac Pro is not for me, and I'm not sure what I should do about it

I know I'm a niche market. I prefer desktops. I would rather avoid all-in-ones. I prefer functionality and capability over aesthetics.

The newly unveiled Mac Pro (and new Pro Display) has been made (or more accurately -- *priced*) at a very narrow segment of **businesses** that have high end *business* needs that are traditionally solved by spending $50k on computer equipment.

The individual who seeks a top of the line computing experience can no longer afford it.

Apple's response to that is "Buy an iMac Pro" -- But here's the thing -- An all-in-one computer is substantially less useful to me not to mention being substantially less cost effective.  I would much rather spend more than a $1k on a display that I could then keep even as the computer needs to be replaced. I can justify spending more because I know I can keep it longer.
