### [Fragtime](https://anilist.co/manga/85402/Fragtime/)

A pretty good (but short) yuri story that is getting an [anime](https://anilist.co/anime/108487/Fragtime/) adaptation this year. At only two volumes, I suspect the adaptation will be a short, but I'm holding out hope that a director will make it a full cour and explore more of the character dynamics that are only implied in the manga.
